    'description.two' => '"Madagascar has 4,000 km of coastline, a rich fauna and flora, 90% endemic, and tourists from all over the world are prepared to fly ten hours just to enjoy a sunset on our beaches. Neighboring islands are rightly jealous of our heritage."',
    'description.three' => 'It\'s in Nosy-Be, the perfume island, that Wimmo has chosen to lay the foundation stone for its tourism and vacation label. In the third quarter of 2021, Ambondrona beach will be home to four (4] vacation villas from the first Alma Villas project.',
    'description.four' => 'Set amid lush, preserved vegetation, these villas invite you to reconnect with nature. The private outdoor pools are surrounded by an exotic garden. Natural materials such as wood, raffia and thatch are used to create an instant sense of serenity and escape. The complex will also be environmentally friendly. It will be equipped with solar panels and a water recuperation and purification system as part of an ecological approach.',
